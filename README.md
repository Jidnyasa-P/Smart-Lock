# Smart Lock

Our project is based on smart door lock system. It involves security and protection.

Working of our code:-

1.  The user needs to enter the passcode.
2.  If the passcode is incorrect (in all of 3 attempts) 3 security questions will be asked. Each question has 3 attempts.
    i) If the user answers all the questions correctly then the door will be opened.
    ii) If the user fails to answer any of the threee questions then the door will be locked and the security will be called.
3.  If the passcode is correct (in any of the 3 attempts).The door will be unlocked.
